# Starter clone project

```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
